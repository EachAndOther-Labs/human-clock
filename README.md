===========

Remember the first time you went on a water slide? Or when you stood under the Eiffel Tower? Remember taking a boat out on Sydney harbour? Chances are, you’re not thinking about the exact time these moments happened at, you remember the moments themselves. That’s what the Human Clock does – it tells time not by big hand and little hand, but by experience. And Instagram photos are the ticks and tocks.  

Using Instagram’s API, the Human Clock takes a feed from a set location and tracks images shared across the globe. Set the clock to the location you want and you’ll get a visual stream from that place. You'll know that it's night time in Tokyo, as more photos of neon signs start to appear. Or that New York is waking up because of all the tourists taking early morning snaps from the Brooklyn Bridge. Or that it’s lunch time in Dublin because of all the pics of fresh pints of Guinness ordered in bars. 

Constructed from timber, three old monitors and three raspberry pi's (not to mention blood, sweat and tears), the Human Clock adorns the reception to iQ towers.

The Human Clock is a full stack Javascript app using NodeJS Express and Socket-io.
