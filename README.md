===========

The human clock is an iQlabs project from iQcontent.

The concept is to replicate visually multiple clocks from multiple time zones in the iQcontent office.

Using the Instagram real time API, photographs from three different cities, Dublin, New York and Tokyo are displayed above the current time in those cities.

Constructed from timber, three old monitors and three raspberry pi's (not to mention blood, sweat and tears), the Human Clock adorns the reception to iQ towers.

The Human Clock is a full stack Javascript app using NodeJS Express and Socket-io.
